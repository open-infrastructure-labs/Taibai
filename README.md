# Taibai

###### **Introduction to Taibai**

Taibai is a multi-cloud management platform which we have built as a new generation, close to user’s business process
and scenario. The Project Taibai came from the Fiberhome’s cloud product family which we call as FitCloud.
Before we decided to make it open source, it has worked with our other cloud products like FitOS which is based on
OpenStack projects and also public clouds and other systems like IT Operation Platform.
Taibai fuses data from those ground system and provide services to help user to orchestrate the network across
different clouds and deploy their business applications being distributed in those clouds to get high available
capacity. We hope it could be a peak like The Taibai Mountain that located in our hometown Xi'an, China.

###### **Goals for The Project Taibai**

Taibai is not just a simple management platform to multi clouds environments, those different requirements or tends
from different trades or industries request A Scalable, Customizable, Integratable and Innovational Architecture of
Multi-Cloud Management Platform. Those goals are what we want to achieve and now we just kick off and finish the first
step. Face to future, Taibai will work together with all the contributors and open infra foundation to collect and
implement more and more user’s requests for multi-cloud management, we hope Taibai could be the one of most suitable
product for different clouds and industries.
